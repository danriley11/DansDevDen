      My reason for creating this website has a lot to do with my innate love for not only designing, creating and story telling, but to provide others with a space that I never personally had (or was aware of) during my journey through software development.
      I've also found that other websites have a great amount of detail on topic(s), but it wouldn't be until I was learning or explicitly researching that topic that I would come across it.
      So in order to accomplish what I love and to overcome my biggest challenge (finding my way through the endless sea of knowledge and content without a mentor or teacher), I have created this website.

      I was born in England, raised by Irish and I'm living in Australia.
      I'm a lover of all things tech and quite creative which has always made it difficult for me to find something to specialise in.
      As a result I've landed as a fullstack developer with a currently stronger skillset in frontend development.
      My ultimate dream would be providing freelance services to small businesses and helping them get off the ground or improving on what they've already achieved.
      Now while I'm learning and growing this dream may change and it's worth noting that I'm most excited currently to work in a larger company to improve my skills, gain experience and expand my knowledge in ways I otherwise wouldn't have the opportunity for.`,
